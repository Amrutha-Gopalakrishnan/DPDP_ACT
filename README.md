# Auto-Compliance Mapper: DPDP Act 2023 Prototype

## Project Overview
The **Auto-Compliance Mapper** is a specialized GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) tool designed to map technical findings and organizational documentation directly to the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023**. 

The core objective is to provide an offline, AI-powered search engine that identifies specific legal violations based on technical issues (e.g., "Lack of encryption") or documentation gaps, helping organizations maintain compliance with Indian data protection laws.

## 🚀 Current Status (Phase 1: Foundation & Data Structuring)

We have successfully completed the high-fidelity data extraction and the library interface.

### ✅ Completed Milestones:
1.  **High-Precision PDF Extraction**: 
    - Converted the official DPDP Act 2023 PDF into clean, normalized text.
    - Automated removal of Gazette noise (headers, footers, Hindi text, ministry details).
2.  **Hierarchical Parsing (The "Brain")**: 
    - Developed a custom Python parser (`split_into_sections.py`) that understands the complex structure of legal documents.
    - **Outcome**: A granular `sections.json` file capturing:
        - Chapters & Section Titles
        - Subsections, Clauses, and Sub-clauses (up to 5 levels of nesting).
        - Illustrations, Provisos, and Explanations.
3.  **DPDP Act Library (Frontend)**:
    - Built a React-based interactive library viewer.
    - **Features**:
        - Real-time search across the entire Act.
        - Hierarchical data rendering (nested legal text).
        - Detailed modal views for focused legal research.

## 🚧 Upcoming Work (Phase 2: The Compliance Search Engine)

To move from a "Library" to a "Compliance Search Engine", the following components must be integrated:

### 1. Local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Implementation
- **Goal**: Allow natural language search and mapping without sending data to the cloud.
- **Tech Stack**: LangChain, ChromaDB (Vector Store), and Sentence-Transformers (Embeddings).
- **Task**: Chunk the `sections.json` into semantic pieces and store them in a local vector database.

### 2. Technical Findings Mapping Engine
- **Goal**: Automatically map a technical finding (e.g., "Password policies are weak") to the corresponding DPDP section.
- **Task**: Build a Python backend that takes external findings, queries the vector store, and uses a **Local LLM** (via Ollama or LlamaCpp) to explain the violation.

### 3. Document Processing (MS Office/Files)
- **Goal**: Upload internal documents (Policies, SOPs) and analyze them against the Act.
- **Tech Stack**: `python-docx` for MS Office files.

### 4. Transition from Dummy Data
- **Task**: Replace the existing frontend mockups in the "Upload" and "Results" pages with the real backend API responses generated by the Local Engine.

---

## 📋 Constraints & Compliance
- **Local-First**: The tool must run entirely offline to protect sensitive technical findings.
- **Open Source**: Built using LangChain, React, and Open-Source LLMs (like Llama 3 or Mistral).
- **Accuracy**: Legal mapping must cite the exact Section/Article from the structured JSON.

## ⚙️ How to Run (Development)

### Data Processing Scripts
```bash
# Extract and clean text from PDF
python scripts/extract_raw_txt.py

# Convert text to hierarchical JSON
python scripts/split_into_sections.py
```

### Frontend UI
```bash
cd "Auto-Compliance Mapper/Auto-Compliance Mapper"
npm install
npm run dev
```
